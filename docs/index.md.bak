This playbook refers to the TSP Section 100

###  2017 Trust Services Criteria for Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy (With Revised Points of Focus — 2022)


## Background

ASEC has developed a set of criteria (trust services criteria) to be used when evaluating the suitability of 
the design and operating effectiveness of controls relevant to the security, availability, or processing integrity of information and systems used to provide products or services, or the confidentiality or privacy 
of information processed by the systems used to provide products or services at an entity, a division, or 
an operating unit of an entity. In addition, the trust services criteria may be used when evaluating the 
design and operating effectiveness of controls relevant to the security, availability, processing integrity, 
confidentiality or privacy of a particular type of information processed by one or more of an entity’s systems or one or more systems used to support a particular function within the entity. This document presents the trust services criteria

## Definition

The TSC defines criteria to control the risks:

- threaten its ability to achieve its objectives due to external and internal threats to the achievement of those objectives 
- the vulnerabilities of its systems, processes, and procedures. 

Such threats and vulnerabilities arise because of factors such as the following: 

1. The nature of the entity’s operations 
2. The environment in which it operates 
3. The types of information generated, used, or stored by the entity 
4. The types of commitments made to customers and other third parties 
5. Responsibilities entailed in operating and maintaining the entity’s systems and processes 
6. The technologies, connection types, and delivery channels used by the entity 
7. The use of third parties (such as service providers and suppliers), who have access to the entity’s 
8. system, to provide the entity with critical raw materials or components or operate controls that are necessary, in combination with the entity’s controls, to achieve the system’s objectives 
9. Changes to the following: 

   1. System operations and related controls 
   2. Processing volume 
   3. Key management personnel of a business unit, supporting IT, or related personnel 
   4. Legal and regulatory requirements with which the entity needs to comply 
 
10. Introduction of new services, products, or technologies

## Objectives

Every entity (business, organization, institiuion) applies this content, and  is responsible for establishing its own **objectives**, assessing the unique **risks** that threaten the achievement of those objectives, and **implementing processes and controls** to **mitigate** those risks to acceptable levels.

## Application and user of Trust Service Criteria

The Trust Service Criteria may be used 

- when evaluating the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of controls relevant to the security, availability, or processing integrity of information and systems, or the confidentiality or privacy of the information processed by the entity. 
- As such, they may be used when evaluating whether the entity’s controls were effective to meet the criteria 
relevant to any of those categories (security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, or privacy), either individually or in combination with controls in other categories. 

### Use Cases of the Trust Service Criteria

The trust services criteria were designed to provide flexibility in application and use for a variety of different subject matters. The following are the types of subject matter a practitioner may be engaged to report on using the trust services criteria: 

- **The effectiveness of controls** within ==an entity’s cybersecurity risk management program== to achieve the entity’s cybersecurity objectives using the trust services criteria relevant to security, availability, and confidentiality as control criteria in a SOC for Cybersecurity examination. 
- **The suitability of design and operating effectiveness of controls** included in management’s description of a ==service organization's== system relevant to one or more of the trust services criteria over security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, or privacy throughout a specified period to achieve the entity’s objectives based on those criteria in a type 2 SOC 2 engagement. A type 2 SOC 2 engagement, which includes an opinion on the operating effectiveness of controls, also includes a detailed description of tests of controls performed by the service auditor and the results of those tests. A type 1 SOC 2 engagement addresses the same subject matter as a type 2 SOC 2 engagement; however, a type 1 SOC 2 report does not contain an opinion on the operating effectiveness of controls nor a detailed description of tests of controls performed by the service auditor and the results of those tests.
- **The design and operating effectiveness** of a ==service organization’s== controls over a system relevant to one or more of the trust services criteria over security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy in a SOC 3® engagement. A SOC 3 report contains an opinion on the operating effectiveness of controls but does not include a detailed description of tests of controls performed by the service auditor and the results of those tests. 
- **The suitability of design and operating effectiveness of controls** of ==an entity==, other than a service organization, over ==one or more systems== relevant to one or more of the trust services categories of security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, or privacy (for example, a SOC for Supply Chain examination). 
- **The suitability of the design of an entity’s controls** over security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, or privacy to achieve the entity’s objectives based on the related trust services criteria.


For example, consider the following engagements: 

- In a SOC 2 engagement to examine and report on a service organization’s controls over the security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, or privacy of a system, management is responsible for meeting its commitments to customers. Therefore, the objectives in a SOC 2 engagement relate to meeting its service commitments to customers and system requirements. Service commitments are the declarations made by management to customers regarding the performance of one or more of the entity’s systems. Such commitments generally are included in written contracts, service-level agreements, or public statements (for example, a privacy notice). Some commitments are applicable to all customers (baseline commitments), whereas others are designed to meet individual customer needs and result in the implementation of processes or controls, in addition to those required to meet the baseline commitments. System requirements refer to how the system should function to achieve the entity’s commitments to customers, relevant laws and regulations, guidelines of industry groups such as trade or business associations, or other business objectives. 
- In a SOC for Supply Chain engagement to examine and report on an entity’s controls over the security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, or privacy of a system used to produce, manufacture, or distribute products, management is responsible for establishing principalsystem objectives. Such objectives are embodied in the product commitments the entity makes to customers, including producing or manufacturing a product that meets product performance specifications and other production, manufacturing, or distribution specifications. Commitments may also relate to other matters (for example, conforming with a variety of other standards and criteria such as the risk entity management framework issued by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the cybersecurity standards issued by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), or Food and Drug Administration regulations on electronic records and electronic signatures included in Code of Federal Regulations, Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures, Title 21, Part 11). 
- In an entity-wide SOC for Cybersecurity examination, the entity establishes cybersecurity objectives. Cybersecurity objectives are those that could be affected by cybersecurity risk and, therefore, affect the achievement of the entity’s compliance, reporting, and operational objectives. The nature of an entity’s cybersecurity objectives will vary depending on the environment in which the entity operates, the entity’s mission and vision, the overall business objectives established by management, and other factors. For example, a telecommunication entity may have a cybersecurity objective related to the reliable functioning of those aspects of its operations that are deemed to be critical infrastructure, whereas an online dating entity is likely to regard the privacy of the personal information collected from customers to be a critical factor in achieving its operating objectives.
